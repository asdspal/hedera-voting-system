# Hedera Voting System

This project implements a decentralized voting system using the Hedera Hashgraph platform. It allows for the creation of voting tokens, deployment of a smart contract for managing votes, and interaction with the voting system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v12 or later)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- A Hedera testnet account (You can create one at [portal.hedera.com](https://portal.hedera.com))

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hedera-voting-system.git
cd hedera-voting-system


2. Install the dependencies:

npm install


## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add your Hedera testnet account ID and private key to the `.env` file:

ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key


## Usage

1. Compile the smart contract:
   - Use Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/) to compile the `VotingSystem.sol` contract.
   - Save the compiled JSON output as `VotingSystem.json` in the project root.

2. Deploy the contract:

node deploy.js

   This will deploy the voting system contract to the Hedera testnet and output the contract ID.

3. Interact with the voting system:
   (Add instructions for interacting with the deployed contract, such as casting votes, checking results, etc.)

## Project Structure

- `VotingSystem.sol`: The Solidity smart contract for the voting system.
- `deploy.js`: Script to deploy the smart contract to Hedera testnet.
- `VotingSystem.json`: Compiled smart contract JSON (generated from Remix IDE).
- `.env`: Configuration file for Hedera account credentials.
- `package.json`: Node.js project manifest.
- `README.md`: This file.
